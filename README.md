# End-to-End API Testing with Selenium, RestAssured, and Java

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform end-to-end API testing using Selenium for web automation and RestAssured for testing RESTful APIs, all implemented in Java. The goal is to validate the functionality of web applications and APIs through automated tests, ensuring all components work together as expected.

## Features

- **Automated UI Testing**: Execute end-to-end tests to validate web applications using Selenium.
- **API Testing**: Validate RESTful APIs using RestAssured to ensure they meet specifications and function correctly.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports to track results and identify issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for writing tests.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A browser automation tool for testing web applications.
- **RestAssured**: A Java library for testing REST APIs.
- **JUnit**: Frameworks for structuring and executing tests.
- **Maven**: Dependency management tool for Java projects.
